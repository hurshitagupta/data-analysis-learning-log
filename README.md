# Data Analysis Learning Journey

Welcome to my Data Analysis Learning Journey repository! This repo serves as my organized and comprehensive record of my learning process in data analysis, covering multiple libraries and topics from FreeCodeCamp courses and other recommended video tutorials.

## Repository Structure
```

```
## What You’ll Find Here

- **Library Notes:** Detailed markdown notes summarizing key concepts and useful tips for libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
- **Practice Exercises:** Jupyter notebooks with code exercises to reinforce learning.
- **Mini-Projects:** Practical projects I’ve built using each library to apply concepts in real-world scenarios.
- **Video Learnings:** Summaries and key takeaways from the FreeCodeCamp course and other recommended video tutorials.

## How to Use This Repo

Feel free to explore the folders corresponding to each topic or library. The notebooks and markdown files are designed for easy reading and hands-on practice. You can also clone the repo and run the Jupyter notebooks locally to try out the code yourself.

## Future Plans

- Add more libraries and tools relevant to data analysis and data science.
- Expand mini-projects with larger, end-to-end datasets and analysis.
- Incorporate collaborations and feedback-driven improvements.
